# BTS 2048 data post-processing

[![License: CC BY-SA 4.0](https://licensebuttons.net/l/by-sa/4.0/80x15.png)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)

The repository contains post-processing scripts to read and visualize solar radiation data exported by the  "Solarscan Software System" (hereinafter referred as Solarscan).


## Description
### General issue
The spectroradiometer BTS2048 is currently operated via a Solarscan. Solarscan is responsible for the a continuous scheduling and the measurement and the radiometric calibration of the BTS2048. Solarscan exports it's data in a specific ASCII-Format, see also [Solarscan User Manual](doc/Solarscan_BTS2048.pdf).

The used file format of the Solarscan export is not well documented. However, the data should be archived in a well documented file format, which will be used of a majority of the Earth science community. The scripts of that repository will take account of this.

### Objectives
The software package is written to post-process observed solar radiation data of the array spectroradiometer BTS2018.
The software package includes
* a module to read OR0-Files from UV observations with the array spectroradiometer BTS2048 and
* a module to visualize the numerical data and
* a module to store data as netcdf file(s).
